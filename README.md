# Skydiver Simulator 🪂

## Overview
This project was selected as a **Global Top 50 winner at Apple’s Swift Student Challenge (WWDC 2024)**.  

The app is a **skydiving simulator game** built to teach the physics of skydiving. Many people (3 out of 5 globally) mistakenly think skydiving is almost certain death — this project helps correct that misconception by making the physics *visual, interactive, and fun*.  

## Features
- 🎮 **Normal Jump Mode** — freefall, parachute deployment, safe landing  
- ⬆️ **High Altitude Jump** — experience unstable air resistance  
- ⬇️ **Low Altitude Jump** — parachute fails to deploy in time  
- ☁️ **Cloudy Weather** — reduced visibility changes how you control descent  
- 🎵 **Dynamic Soundtrack** — AI-generated background music  

## Impact
- 🏆 **WWDC 2024 Swift Challenge Global Top 50** – presented to Tim Cook  
- 📚 Adopted by a Toronto skydiving center as a teaching aid, reaching **1,000+ learners**  
- 🚀 Demonstrated how AI can accelerate **0→1 full-stack product building** in just 2 days  

## Next Steps
- 🌐 Evolve into an **interactive sports education platform**  
- 🥽 Integrate **VR/AR** for immersive training experiences  
- 🔄 Expand simulator scenarios to cover more extreme sports physics  

## Tech Stack
- **Language / Framework:** Swift, SpriteKit  
- **AI Tools:**  
  - Figma + Magician AI → Flows and UI variations  
  - DALL·E 3 → Storyboard-style visuals  
  - Suno AI → Soundtrack generation  
  - Cursor → Code editor + animation logic  
  - ChatGPT-4 → Physics engine equations (freefall, drag, parachute deceleration)  
  - Figma Make → AI edits on prototypes  
  - CI Fuzz AI Agent → Device + user scenario robustness testing
